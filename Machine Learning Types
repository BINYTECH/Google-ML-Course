What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning (ML) powers some of the most important technologies we use, from translation apps to autonomous vehicles. 

ML offers a new way to solve problems, answer complex questions, and create new content.
ML can predict the weather, estimate travel times, recommend songs, auto-complete sentences, summarize articles, and generate never-seen-before images.

In basic terms, ML is the process of training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions or generate content (like text, images, audio, or video) from data.

For example, suppose we wanted to create an app to predict rainfall. We could use either a traditional approach or an ML approach. 
Using a traditional approach, we'd create a physics-based representation of the Earth's atmosphere and surface, computing massive amounts of fluid dynamics equations. This is incredibly difficult.

Using an ML approach, we would give an ML model enormous amounts of weather data until the ML model eventually learned the mathematical relationship between weather patterns that produce differing amounts of rain.
We would then give the model the current weather data, and it would predict the amount of rain.

What is a "model" in machine learning?
Ans: A model is a mathematical relationship derived from data that an ML system uses to make predictions.

Types of ML Systems

ML systems fall into one or more of the following categories based on how they learn to make predictions or generate content:
1.Supervised learning
2.Unsupervised learning
3.Reinforcement learning
4.Generative AI

*** Supervised learning ****
Supervised learning models can make predictions after seeing lots of data with the correct answers and then discovering the connections between the elements in the data that produce the correct answers. 

Two of the most common use cases for supervised learning are regression and classification.

===> Regression : A regression model predicts a numeric value. For example, a weather model that predicts the amount of rain, in inches or millimeters, is a regression model.

See the table below for more examples of regression models:

Scenario	                                                Possible input data	                                                       Numeric prediction
Future house price	      Square footage, zip code, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, mortgage interest rate,              The price of the home.
                          property tax rate, construction costs, and number of homes for sale in the area.	
Future ride time	        Historical traffic conditions (gathered from smartphones, traffic sensors, ride-hailing and                The time in minutes and seconds 
                          other navigation applications), distance from destination, and weather conditions.	                       to arrive at a destination.

==>Classification : Classification models predict the likelihood that something belongs to a category. Unlike regression models, whose output is a number, 
                    classification models output a value that states whether or not something belongs to a particular category. 
                    For example, classification models are used to predict if an email is spam or if a photo contains a cat.

Classification models are divided into two groups: binary classification and multiclass classification. 
* Binary classification models output a value from a class that contains only two values, for example, a model that outputs either rain or no rain. 
* Multiclass classification models output a value from a class that contains more than two values, for example, a model that can output either rain, hail, snow, or sleet.

==>Unsupervised learning: An unsupervised learning model aims to identify meaningful patterns in a dataset. 
                         For example, many unsupervised learning models rely on a technique called clustering to organize similar data into groups ("clusters").

                          Clustering differs from classification because the categories aren't defined by you.
                          For example, an unsupervised model might cluster a weather dataset based on temperature, revealing segmentations that define the seasons.
                          You might then attempt to name those clusters based on your understanding of the dataset.

==>Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning models make predictions by getting rewards or penalties based on actions performed within an environment. 
                           A reinforcement learning system generates a policy that defines the best strategy for getting the most rewards.

                          Reinforcement learning is used to train robots to perform tasks, like walking around a room, and software programs like AlphaGo to play the game of Go.

==>Generative AI: Generative AI is a class of models that creates content from user input. 
                  For example, generative AI can create unique images, music compositions, and jokes; it can summarize articles, explain how to perform a task, or edit a photo.

                Generative AI can take a variety of inputs and create a variety of outputs, like text, images, audio, and video. 
                It can also take and create combinations of these. For example, a model can take an image as input and create an image and text as output, 
                or take an image and text as input and create a video as output.

                 We can discuss generative models by their inputs and outputs, typically written as "type of input"-to-"type of output."
                 For example, the following is a partial list of some inputs and outputs for generative models:

                 * Text-to-text
                 * Text-to-image
                 * Text-to-video
                 * Text-to-code
                 * Text-to-speech
                 * Image and text-to-image
